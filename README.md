R demos for categorical data visualisation and 3D bathtub 

The two folders correspond to two demos that were shown in my 12. March 2015 Data Visualisation talk organised by the Oxford Academic IT Research Support Team.

### vcd - Visualising Categorical Data - in 3D using rgl
Run robinson3d.R. Should install and load required packages, data and plot data cube. Not comprehensively tested. 



### bathtub - 3D Rendering of Lexis Surface - using shiny
Open either server.R or ui.R - doesn't matter which. Click on Run app. 
Also, as a bonus, rglAnimation is the code for "recording" a series of rotations of the object, the resulting pictures are in /pics, as is the pdf animation.pdf, which plays the animation. The .tex file that produced the animation is also there.
